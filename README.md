## 🚀 About Our Organization
We are a passionate team of **eight 3rd-year ECE students** from  
**Loyola-ICAM College of Engineering and Technology (LICET), Chennai**, collaboratively working to gain practical exposure to the **VLSI → RTL → Synthesis → Physical Design → Tapeout** flow.

We created this GitHub **organization** as our shared engineering workspace to:

- Collaborate like an industry team  
- Track all VLSI-based projects  
- Learn complete RTL to GDSII workflows  
- Document and present our learning journey  
- Build semiconductor engineering skills beyond academics  

---

## 🎯 Our Mission
To understand and implement the complete **ASIC Design Flow**, including:

- RTL Design  
- Functional Verification  
- Synthesis  
- Timing Analysis (STA)  
- Floorplanning, Placement & Routing  
- GDSII Generation  
- Tapeout-Level Understanding  

Our goal is to become **industry-ready VLSI engineers** and bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real semiconductor workflows.

## 🏆 Why This Initiative Matters
India’s semiconductor growth demands graduates who are:

- Strong in RTL + Verification  
- Comfortable with EDA tools  
- Familiar with ASIC flows  
- Team-oriented and industry-ready  
- Able to work with open-source & proprietary tools  

However, **most academic programs do not offer tapeout-level exposure**.

We are solving this gap through real, practical engineering.
